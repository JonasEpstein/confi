# Introduction

Welcome to this Conservation Finance e-Book. Several of the articles in this book and the underlying pilot project were originally supported by a 2022 California Department of Water Resources, Integrated Regional Water Management, Disadvantaged Community Involvement Technical Assistance grant to the Yuba Water Agency. The resources created under that grant provided a foundation for additional collaboration between the authors of this e-book and for further developing conservation finance strategies in project areas across Northern California. Please see the initial report, [Because It's Worth It](http://gg.gg/1aut0n) for an additional complement to this resource.

## Conservation Finance
<!-- With the wild swings in public fund availability, businesses, nonprofits, and agencies seek sustainable funding models and approaches that leverage both public and private investments in natural resource conservation and infrastructure.

Conservation finance offers an emerging approach to securing long-term, predictable finance for landscape-scale conservation and forest health projects. In contrast to traditional project financing approaches, conservation finance also fosters effective collaboration between private and public sectors, creating stakeholders and investors from the pool of project beneficiaries. This innovative strategy achieves multiple goals:

- Channels capital into forest management projects that offer overlapping ecological, social, and financial outcomes.
- Attracts private investment by quantifying ecosystem services to create a value proposition for beneficiaries, who will pay for these benefits.
- Utilizes partnerships to strengthen the financial foundation for restoration, reforestation, and post-fire recovery.
- Reduces the burden on public budgets.
- Increases the pace and scale at which these initiatives are completed.
- Enables the long-term protection of forests and related natural resources, ensuring their invaluable benefits persist for future generations.[^1]
