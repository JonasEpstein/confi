## Takeaways
- Bullet list of key points

## Threats
The escalating crises in our ecological systems are becoming inextricably linked with disruptions to established socioeconomic structures, making them impossible to overlook. For centuries, we have subjugated, paved, and engineered over natural landscapes, forcing them to conform to our desires. There is an expanding understanding of the vital importance of ecosystem services. However, we are now reverse-engineering the very ecosystems that have been artificially manipulated and mismanaged over time to adapt to stabilize communities, habitats, and large-scale industry.

## Nature-based solutions
Despite their importance, our ecosystems are significantly underfunded until the inevitable disasters occur, and taxpayers are left to shoulder the cost. Now is the time to take action and recalibrate capitalist incentives to align with our ecological needs, lest we risk plunging our carefully constructed societal order into disarray.

## Restoration/conservation status quo
- Many approaches work (cf. [conservation evidence database and journal](https://www.conservationevidence.com/)).
- Funding for projects is nowhere close to meet the demand.
- Perverse incentives and policies hinder or destroy conservation/restoration efforts.
- Scale mismatch between landscape need vs. project level implementation (and funding).
- Many organizations competing for the same funding and even project sites, often without coordination or leveraging workforce capacity, equipment, funding, and environmental compliance.
- Connecting funders to project implementers is difficult, arduous, or takes too long.
- Environmental pathways for white flag projects are lengthy and take funding away from implementation.
- High need to subsidize conservation costs.

## Finance solutions
- Environmental impact finance bonds have been proposed and implemented to leverage private funds with public dollars. 
- Market-based incentives and solutions.
- Outcomes bank. Promise and reality
- Ecotrust models with ownership of assets and selling outputs
- A few cases that are working or innovation is taking place

## Scale
- Unprecedented federal and state investment, how to leverage private investment to match?
- Getting beyond bespoke solutions that are hyper-local to regional to replicate rapidly elsewhere.
- Getting beyond the slow uptake curve to rapid uptake.
- Getting beyond bau especially with local organizations averse to risk or new finance mechanisms.

## Trends or moving forward


## Additional points/notes
- What happens when funds avail themselves? Weâ€™ve seen an unprecedented federal investment over the past five years, yet relatively little coordination outside of specific programs and instances
- What does the private sector need to do? What do communities need to do? What do governments need to do? What do NGOs need to do?
