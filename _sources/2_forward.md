## Threats
The escalating crises in our ecological systems are becoming inextricably linked with disruptions to established socioeconomic structures, making them impossible to overlook. For centuries, we have subjugated, paved, and engineered over natural landscapes, forcing them to conform to our desires. There is an expanding understanding of the vital importance of ecosystem services. However, we are now reverse-engineering the very ecosystems that have been artificially manipulated and mismanaged over time to adapt to stabilize communities, habitats, and large-scale industry.

## Nature-based solutions
Despite their importance, our ecosystems are significantly underfunded until the inevitable disasters occur, and taxpayers are left to shoulder the cost. Now is the time to take action and recalibrate capitalist incentives to align with our ecological needs, lest we risk plunging our carefully constructed societal order into disarray.

## Status quo
- Many approaches work (cf. [conservation evidence database and journal](https://www.conservationevidence.com/)).
- Funding for projects is nowhere close to meet the demand.
- Perverse incentives and policies hinder or destroy conservation/restoration efforts.
- Scale mismatch between landscape need vs. project level implementation (and funding).
- Many organizations competing for the same funding and even project sites, often without coordination or leveraging workforce capacity, equipment, funding, and environmental compliance.
- Connecting funders to project implementers is difficult, arduous, or takes too long.
- Environmental pathways for white flag projects are lengthy and take funding away from implementation.
- High need to subsidize conservation costs.

## Solutions
- Environmental impact finance bonds have been proposed and implemented to leverage private funds with public dollars. 
- Market-based incentives and solutions.
- Outcomes bank. Promise and reality
- Ecotrust models with ownership of assets and selling outputs
- A few cases that are working or innovation is taking place

## Scale
- Unprecedented federal and state investment, how to leverage private investment to match?
- Getting beyond bespoke solutions that are hyper-local to regional to replicate rapidly elsewhere.
- Getting beyond the slow uptake curve to rapid uptake.
- Getting beyond bau especially with local organizations averse to risk or new finance mechanisms.

## Watersheds & payors
There are two main buckets of watershed projects, the second of which currently has limited non-public payor options over the long-term: 

1. Bucket 1 projects produce outcomes that can be sold into existing markets (e.g., sustainable forestry and processing infrastructure – board feet; organic farm conversion – premium food). These projects can be more readily consolidated to an industrial scale and the land used to support this work is primarily or solely used to produce the saleable outcome. These projects have a better chance of weaning off public funding sources as they scale. 
2. Bucket 2 projects are smaller and more distributed, and will continue to require significant subsidies because they usually layer a practice on top of or into the primary land use, take a portion of land out of production, or fix degradation (e.g., on-farm practices, managed aquifer recharge, riparian buffers, post-burn restoration, easements). The primary outcomes from these projects (e.g., water quality, water quantity, GHGs, flood risk reduction, fire risk reduction) usually do not have an existing market into which to sell. 

In short, our long-term funding plan for bucket #2 work is: 

1. Create/amend/move big public programs toward leveraged, prioritized, and streamlined investment;
2. Bring together those pieces in targeted watersheds to prove out the outcomes bank model;
3. Use those better results as the case to maintain or increase funding levels; and
4. Where they exist, we will also build/stack on other non-public funding sources (e.g., Microsoft and AWS in the Cosumnes), but not lead with them.  

The Freshwater Trust’s work is focused on bucket 2. In bucket 2, we often need to stack together multiple payors to make projects pencil, and most of those payors are public. There are occasional compliance buyers who must act pursuant to the Clean Water Act, ESA, or some other mitigation obligation, but these entities do not exist at a meaningful scale in most watersheds. With a few exceptions, corporate water CSR/supply chain funds have remained orders of magnitude smaller than public funds, and the private markets that do care (e.g., insurance) are still too fragmented or high level to drive meaningful funding at the watershed or project scale. Occasionally, a progressive utility will invest to avoid future potential costs. Accordingly, until major shifts in regulation or corporate behavior or risk mitigation occurs, we believe that public funding programs will continue to do the heavy payor lifting for bucket 2 work. 

Given these realities, we are focused on improving public program prioritization, enabling public funds to be better leveraged together, and delivering funding more efficiently to the right projects. Our policy efforts have focused on enabling that future through some of the biggest recurring bucket #2 spending agencies: 

1. Watershed Results Act (worked with Sen. Wyden to develop a pilot outcomes-based purchasing program under US DOI); 
2. EPA nutrient funding group (co-led a work group with EPA to develop a framework for EPA to integrate its regulatory, SRF/WIFIA financing and watershed work in a similar way – see PDF; late June workshop being hosted at EPA);
3. Farm Bill amendments to the partner-led RCPP program (to remedy issues that have plagued the program – see pages 20-22 of PDF for Senate-side edits we led on);
4. Protect the West Act (integrated PFP options into USFS spending); and 
5. California via the CA Climate Bond (got pilot watershed program into draft – section 91031).

## Additional points/notes
- What happens when funds avail themselves? We’ve seen an unprecedented federal investment over the past five years, yet relatively little coordination outside of specific programs and instances
- What does the private sector need to do? What do communities need to do? What do governments need to do? What do NGOs need to do?
